# ðŸ¦  FireGuard Antivirus

FireGuard Antivirus is a Python desktop application that performs static and behavioral malware analysis. A small Flask backend manages user accounts, logs, and version updates. An optional developer tool (**EXD**) lets admins review clients, push updates and inspect logs.

You can try the hosted API at [wsl-agjq.onrender.com](https://wsl-agjq.onrender.com/).

## Quick Start
1. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Launch the client
   ```bash
   python fireguard.py
   ```
   The first run asks you to register or log in. Credentials are stored in `license.json` and used for all API calls.

### Building a Windows executable
```bash
pip install pyinstaller
pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole fireguard.py
```

Set `API_URL` to point the client to your backend:
```bash
API_URL=https://myserver.com python fireguard.py
```

## Server Setup
1. Install requirements:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Environment variables:
   - `MONGO_URI` â€“ MongoDB connection URI
   - `MONGO_DB_NAME` â€“ database name (default `FireGuard`)
   - `SECRET_KEY` â€“ Flask secret for JWTs
   - `ADMIN_PASS` â€“ initial admin password
   - `LATEST_VERSION` â€“ current client version tag
  - `LATEST_BINARY` â€“ path to the latest `.exe` served via `/release` (auth required)
3. Start locally with:
   ```bash
   python server.py
   ```
   or in production:
   ```bash
   gunicorn server:app
   ```

A minimal configuration for Render is provided in `render.yaml`.

## Developer Tool (EXD)
Run `python exd.py` to launch the admin toolkit. After logging in you can:
- View registered clients and their HWIDs
- Push a new client version
- Toggle bans or remove users
- Browse logs in real time

EXD is distributed under the same MIT License as the rest of FireGuard. You may
share the compiled `exd.exe` freely as long as the license file is included. This free management tool lets you oversee client registrations and push new versions.

## Admin Dashboard
The backend exposes `/admin` â€“ a simple page listing API routes with a green/red status indicator and the total user count. Use your EXD credentials to log in.

### Built-in API docs
Browse `/docs` on the server to view styled pages for each API endpoint. Subpages describe the method and purpose of the route and link directly to the live API.

The landing page at `/` now contains a small HTML/JavaScript interface for registering or logging in using the API. Successful requests show the returned token on screen. The page and the builtâ€‘in docs use a cleaner theme for easier navigation.
